INTRODUCTION
More and more, electric vehicles are becoming a viable option for car purchasers. Tens of thousands of EV’s are sold each month and share the road with traditional, gasoline-powered automobiles. Manufacturers are rapidly building charging stations across the world in order to meet demands for these new vehicles. While gasoline is going nowhere anytime soon, electric vehicles are here to stay and look to compete with traditional automobiles for the average consumer.
Tesla has led the way in EV production and has forced other manufacturers to play catch-up. Now nearly every major car company has released at least one electric model. While initially a luxury, electric cars are now being built and priced for the average car purchaser, signaling that EV’s have a place in the future of the automobile industry. 
INSPIRATION & REASONING 
Our inspiration comes from recent events and renewed focus of car companies on the electric vehicle market.  Companies such as Ford and GM are eager to take a part in the electric vehicle market that Tesla has captured.  Our focus was in the sought after EV features and the average sales of the top selling EV companies.
MACHINE LEARNING HYPOTHESIS
With the information we collected on electric vehicles, we wanted to look at the rising popularity of ev’s and their sustainability in the market. 
Will electric vehicle prices level out with the rising popularity and increased availability from more car companies? 
Will electric vehicle sales continue to rise?
Which features are the most sought after and which companies are at the top for each type of feature (acceleration, range, battery size, fast charge, body type and price) ?
What’s the ROI on EVs?
Based on analysis comparing Gas, Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, we believe that the ROI in an Electric Vehicle will pay off.
DESIGN CHOICES 
Staying inline with the “living green” aesthetic, our color choices were blues and greens in our site style and visuals.
Our site was designed to be a streamlined site with a navigation bar in the upper left corner, a Tableau link and homepage with our predictions link.

2) Battery Size - Tesla, Ford, Jaguar, Porsche, and Audi. 
3) Acceleration Rate - Porsche, Tesla, Jaguar, Volvo and Audi. 
4) Range - Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Jaguar and Audi. 
5) Body Type - (Most expensive) Station, Sedan, Cabrio, Liftback, Pickup and SUV. 
Cost
Least Expensive & Most Expensive - 2022 Nissan LEAF S - $20,875 and the Most Expensive - 2021 Porsche Teycan Turbo S Cross Turismo - $181,450
Top Sales by Model - Volt by Chevrolet (7,842,018 units), Leaf by Nissan (6,718,274 units), Model S & Model 3 by Tesla (6,616,676 & 2,217,211 units)


LIMITATIONS 
One of our limitations includes the fact that our 2019 data was not complete, therefore we took the average sales for the Tableau Sales Visuals. Also we needed a data source that could be merged with sales that had car models that matched with our original data source. 

FUTURE WORK 
We would like to examine charging station availability by state and how vehicle charging rate affects vehicle maintenance costs.
